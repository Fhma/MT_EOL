# This configuration file is read by Stage2 runnable java code. The Stage2 executes the original EOL programs located 
# in "candidates" folder. It executes each EOL program candidate against a set of input 
# models located in "inModels" folder. The outcomes is a set of outputs (whether are texts or xmi models) that are stored in "expectedModels" folder, which then 
# are considered as oracles for mutations analysis using mutation execution stage (Stage3).
#
# Required resources are: 
#	1) candidates EOL programs stored in "candidates" folder
#	2) input models of EOL programs stored in "inModels" folder using the following structure
#	<EOLMODULENAME>/<INPUTMODELNAME>
#	3) metamodels of input models stored in "metamodels" folder
