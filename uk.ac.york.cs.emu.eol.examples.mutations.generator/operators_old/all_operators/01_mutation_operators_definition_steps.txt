Mutation operator definition steps:
	For current object/type DO
		1) for each attribute in all self.attributes DO
			Method 1) apply mutation addition action
			Method 2) apply mutation deletion action
			Method 3) apply mutation replacement action
			 
		2) for each relation in all self.relations DO
			Method 4) apply mutation addition where single element is possible to add
			Method 5) apply mutation deletion and delete one instance at a time
			Method 6) apply mutation replacement and replace one instance with another/new sibling
				where values of the sibling are copied over where applicable
