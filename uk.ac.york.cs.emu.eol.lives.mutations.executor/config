# This configuration file is read by Stage3 runnable java code. The Stage3 Java application executes the mutations located in "mutations" folder, which were obtained
# from executing Stage1 java application located in Java package "uk.ac.york.cs.emu.eol.examples.mutations.generator", against the input test models located in folder
# "inModels". The Java program then compares the output of each execution with oracles obtained from executing Stage2 java application located in
# "uk.ac.york.cs.emu.eol.examples.mutations.generator" Java package.
#
# Required resources are:
#	1) candidates EOL programs stored in "candidates" folder
#	2) input models of EOL programs stored in "inModels" folder using the following structure
#	<EOLMODULENAME>/<INPUTMODELNAME>
#	3) original outputs of executing original EOL programs using Stage2 java application. The outputs are stored in "expectedModels" folder using the following structure
#	<EOLMODULENAME>/<OUTPUTNAME>
#	4) input and output models metamodels stored in "metamodels" folder
#	5) mutations of original EOL programs that were obtained from executing Stage1 Java application located in "uk.ac.york.cs.emu.eol.examples.mutations.generator"
#	Java package. The mutations should be organised according to the following structure.
#	<EOLMODULENAME>/<MUTANTNAME>
